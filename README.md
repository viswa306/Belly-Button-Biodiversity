# Plotly_Challenge

*In this challenge, I took data stored in json format and used the D3 library to read it in JavaScript. Using a flask app, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the data, allowing a user to choose a subject ID number from a dropdown menu. 

* Users can select a sample number from the drop down menu to select the participant in the study and view the dashboard changing with respect to the participant's measurements.

The following plots are included in the dashboard using the app.js framwork:

* A pie chart to view the proportion of the top 10 samples and their OTU ID and bacteria info on hover
* A bubble chart to see OTU_IDs vs. the sample value with the size of the bubble determined by the sample value
* A Bar chart with the top 10 OTU ids.
